# lisa-speech-assistant
Here, I made a simple personal speech assistant called Lisa which has several simple functionalities. It made for educational purposes. It works a little bit slower than I expected. It is because of several factors such as internet speed and computer power. If you want a tutorial or screencast, please comment below.
